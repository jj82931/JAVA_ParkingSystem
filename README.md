# JAVA_ParkingSystem
Project Summary
A company for selling used cars (maximum 20 years old) has a car park site. A small 
system is required that will help manage used cars at a parking site for the company. You 
are to develop a system that should has following four classes:
•        Application class
•        CarPark class
•        ParkingSpot class
•        Car class
Application is the Console (Text Based) Interface class including the main() method and 
handling all inputs and outputs.
CarPark is responsible for maintaining a list of available parking spots. You should be able 
to add a spot, delete a spot, provide a list of all spots included in the car park, park a car, find 
/ remove a car by registration number, find cars by the make and reset car park.
A parking spot must have an identifier, which starts with a capital letter, followed by a 
three- digit number e.g. “D001”, “E127”. A parking spot should also know if a car is parked 
in the spot. You must be able to add a car to the spot and remove a car from the spot.
A car will be identified by its registration number. A registration number always starts with a 
capital letter, followed by a four-digit number e.g. “T1234”. A car should also have its make, 
model, and year.
